# cpp
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++)).

### fixed point number vs floating point number?
In C++, a fixed point number is a data type that represents a real number 
with a fixed number of decimal places, whereas a floating point number is a data 
type that can represent a wider range of numbers with varying precision. 
Fixed point numbers are often used when it is necessary to have a precise decimal 
representation, such as in financial applications. Floating point numbers, 
on the other hand, are typically used when working with scientific or engineering data 
where the exact decimal representation is not as important.
